The sensors are connected to an Arduino Mega 2560 board that continuously scans the state of the squares and transmits the information via the serial port to an application coded in Python, which feeds the Flutter application displaying the moves played live. The project included complete hardware design (assembly, wiring, painting, inlaying of sensors and magnets) and software development (Arduino code to detect movements, Python interface, mobile application), with the aim of an intuitive interface enabling users to easily view the progress of a game on their smartphone.";
